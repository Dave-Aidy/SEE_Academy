# Fun Calculator

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! ðŸŽ‰ This simple Python program lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers with a fun and friendly vibe. ðŸ˜Ž

## Features

- Accepts decimal numbers (floats) as input
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Displays results clearly with playful comments and emojis

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. View the results for sum, difference, product, and quotient.

## Code Highlights

- Uses `float()` for flexible decimal number inputs.
- Simple arithmetic operations with clear variable names.
- Fun, easy-to-understand comments make the code beginner-friendly.
- Assumes the user inputs a valid number and does not divide by zero.

## Example Output

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0
```

## Notes

- Currently, the program does not handle division by zero errors, so avoid entering zero as the second number.
- Feel free to expand this mini-calculator with additional features like error handling or more operations!

If you want, I can help you enhance the code with input validation and error handling too!
